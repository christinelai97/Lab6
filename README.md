# Lab6
This is my sixth lab assignment for CISC 3130. This Repository contains a program that calculates a student's final grade for CISC3130 by
adding the their total scores in their practice problem assignments, lab assignments, midterms, and final exam. The numerical grade is
then converted into a letter grade.
